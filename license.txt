============

None of this mod would have been possible without thousands if not million
people that waived rights on their creations. There would be no minetest,
no linux system for me to work on. No Stackoverflow. No github.
LUA would not exist and neither would the internet. Even your router runs a linux kernel.

Whenever you create something please consider if you can afford to waive your rights on it.
Copyrights and Patents are what slows humanity down. They don't protect invention
they just hinder it in exchange for profit.
